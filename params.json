I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.\r\n\r\nBTC: [1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx](bitcoin:1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx) | TRC: [1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG](terracoin:1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG) | LTC: [LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5](litecoin:LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5)\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll also take [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G2M23XDAB8HBA)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nForked - Forked\r\n===============\r\n\r\nI forked this fork because the original site went down shortly after launch, but it said to fork it...

Forked - Forked
===============

I forked this fork because the original site went down shortly after launch, but it said to fork it... So I did.

See if the latest block is forked:
 - [blockchainforked.herokuapp.com](blockchainforked.herokuapp.com)

See if the chain was forked at a certain height
 - [blockchainforked.herokuapp.com/225430](http://blockchainforked.herokuapp.com/225430)

That's pretty much it.
